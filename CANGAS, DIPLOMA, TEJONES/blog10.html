				<p>Campuestohan Highland Resort is a fun-filled tourist destination located between the cities of Bacolod and Talisay in Negros Occidental. The five-hectare highland resort is one of the go-to places not only for Negrenses but also travelers from different parts of the country because of its cool temperatures. The view of the Negros Occidental province and even Panay Island will leave nature lovers amazed.</p>
				<p>Aside from a regular swimming pool, Campuestohan Highland Resort also has a four-lane wave pool. The resort also has a variety of rides for thrill-seekers. Apart from the 340-meter zip line, the resort also has a sky bicycle. Tourists can show off their ability to ride a bicycle while suspended mid-air. It also has a hang glider zip line, the first of its kind in the Philippines.</p>
				<p>The resort can accommodate both day-trippers and those who wish to spend a night or two. There are cottages that come at different prices for those who plan to stay for only a day in the resort. Those who wish to spend their vacation there can rent the resortâ€™s unique and quirky-looking rooms.</p>
