				<p>Waterfalls and springs just a few walks away from your doorstep at Mailum Falls and Spring Resort.</p>
				<p>Mailum Falls and Spring Resort is an eco-park and mountain resort nestled in the nature-filled town of Bago City – just 30 minutes away from the City of Smiles, Bacolod City. It is a hidden gem within the city that proves quite a challenge in terms of accessibility but it wouldn’t be much of a hidden gem if it was easily found by anyone. Despite the challenge in locating the resort, it possesses a bounty of natural wonders that are more than worth the trouble to anyone that discovers it.</p>
