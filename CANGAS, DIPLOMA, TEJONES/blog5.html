				<p>The pure white sand of Lakawon Island Resorts is a haven of peace and relaxation and a place for one to rejuvenate. Lakawon Island Resorts is scattered within 16 hectares offering all the comforts of home available in our spacious accommodations. Now under new management, Lakawon Island Resorts is further expanding into a bigger, more luxurious resort right in the heart of Negros. Whether on a getaway, honeymoon, or just the desire to relax and rejuvenate, Lakawon Island Resorts is the perfect island persuasion.</p>
				<p>Lakawon, also called Llacaon, is a 16-hectare, banana-shaped island off the coast of Cadiz in the northern portion of Negros Occidental, a province in the Negros Island Region of the Philippines. It is the home of TawHai, the biggest floating bar in Asia.</p>
				<p>Here at Lakawon, an air of tranquility is adorned with shady coconut trees, and there is no better spot to watch the gentle waves far from the noise and congestion of the modern world. The distinctive atmosphere is evident throughout the resort, from the warm and welcoming staff to the woven roofs of each cottage.</p>
