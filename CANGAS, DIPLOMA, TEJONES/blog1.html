				<p>Campoquino Bay Beach Resort is outfitted with all the makings of paradise – a wide sandy shore, a lush grove of palm trees, wide open grounds, and a view of the vast sea ahead.</p>
				<p>The shore is carpeted in smooth cream-like sand about 40 meters wide and almost 300 meters long. Thriving trees provide shade, making the shore just perfect for walks, activities, and even camping! Finally, the stretch of sea ahead draws inspiration as the view of vivid blue hues are bordered by lively verdant hills.</p>
				<p>The resort also has ample accommodation which are spaced apart to avoid overcrowding. They have rooms for solo travelers, couples, families, and even big groups – everyone is welcome! Their rooms are simple, yet you’ll find them clean and cozy with everything in order.</p>
